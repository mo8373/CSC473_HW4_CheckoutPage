# CheckoutPage HW #4 for CSc 47300 at CCNY
 
 
I'll be creating a standalone checkout page as homework for my Web Site Design course at CCNY - CSc 47300.

## Requirements

* Build a checkout form. See this link as an example. You should have a billing address section, shipping address section, payment section, and a cart section.
* If the checkbox “Shipping address is the same as my billing address” is clicked, then the shipping address section shouldn’t appear.
* Add null/empty validation to each input. Your validation can happen after users type in or on submit click.
* Push your code to git (any repo) and submit the link in your HW. This should not be 1 huge commit. Commit & push small updates as you work. I will also require the code in Gradescope. It has a plagiarism detection feature.
* I should be able to simply clone your repo & open your HTML file in my browser to run it. Meaning, you can use bootstrap, sass, etc, but no dependencies on webpack, node, etc.
