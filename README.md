# CSC473_HW4_CheckoutPage
 
 
I'll be creating a standalone checkout page as homework for my Web Site Design course at CCNY - CSc 47300.

It'll be similar to a bootstramp demo checkout page (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/checkout/) but I will be building my own from scratch using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
